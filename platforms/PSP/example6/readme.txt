Webfest v1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jum Hig 2008

Webfest is a game based on Tempest, and is meant as an example for E3D cross-platform 3D Scene library. It was also supposed to be a testbed for different gameplay ideas for "tunnel shooter" type games, but as you will see, Webfest is only slightly different from Tempest because I have run out of time to experiment with my other gamepay ideas.

Webfest was originally released as an entry in GBAX 2007 competition, in an alpha state.

Please read manual.txt for instructions on how to play Webfest.


It has only been tested on my PSP with 3.02 OE-B custom firmware.

Install by copying the webfest folder to  /PSP/GAME on your PSP. (Other destinations might work too).

As usual, comments and suggestions are welcome.
