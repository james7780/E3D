E3D User Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The E3D library is a simple "3D Scene Library", intended to make the creation of 3D scenes for games and apps as easy as possible.

A simple 3D scene is composed from a light, a camera, and some 3D objects.

A more complex 3D scene will have multiple lights, multiple cameras, and many 3D objects.

A tree view of the scene's structure looks like this:

+ SCENE
    |
    + Lights
    |
    + Cameras
    |
    + Models
    |
    + Object Lists
        |
        + Objects (Instances)

Up to 8 lights are supported.
Up to n cameras are supported.
Up to n models are supported.
UP to n object instances are supported.	
       


Every 3D object in a scene is an "instance" of a 3D model. For example, your scene may need to have 13 trees in it at different positions and scales (sizes). To accomplish this, you will need to load a 3D model of a tree into your scene, and then create 13 3D objects at the correct position and scale, that all reference the 3D tree model.

The scene organises the object instances in "object lists".


Basic code required to create a 3D scene:

E3D_Scene scene;				// the scene object
scene.Start()					// reset the 3D scene
scene.AddModel(modelname, filename);		// add a model to the scene (not visible/drawable)
scene.AddObject(0, modelname)			// add an object to the scene's first object list 
scene.GetObject(0, 0)->SetPosition(x, y, z);	// set position of the first object in the scene's first object list
scene.Render(width, height, true);		// draw the scene using the relevant driver

See example1 to example6


Limitations:

1. Only wireframe and flat-shaded polygons are supported (so far) (no textures).
2. Each model can have a maximum of about 2000 vertices or polygons (see E3D.h).
3. Each scene can have a maximum of about 2000 models.
4. Only the first light and the first camera in the scene are used (so far).
