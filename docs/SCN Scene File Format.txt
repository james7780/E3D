2. Scene File Format (.scn files)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The scene file has a similar format to the model file, but
has different commands:

Comments:
# all comment lines start with a '#'
# everything after the # on that line is ignored

Lights:
light type, fX, fY, fZ, fR, fG, fB
(where type = "omni" or "distant")

Camera:
camera fX, fY, fZ, fdX, fdY, fdZ, fuX, fuY, fuZ, fviewangle

Model:
model name filename

Object:
object "filename.3do", fX, fY, fZ, frX, frY, frZ, fsX, fsY, fsZ
 
"end" to end file

Take a look at an example .scn file for clarification.
