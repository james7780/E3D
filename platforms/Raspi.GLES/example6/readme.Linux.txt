Webfest v1.2 (Linux SDL/OpenGL version)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Webfest is a game based on Tempest, and is meant as an example for E3D cross-platform 3D Scene library. It was also supposed to be a testbed for different gameplay ideas for "tunnel shooter" type games, but as you will see, Webfest is only slightly different from Tempest because I have run out of time to experiment with my other gamepay ideas.

Webfest was originally released for the PSP as an entry in GBAX 2007 competition, in an alpha state.

Please read manual.txt for instructions on how to play Webfest.

Install by copying the Webfest folder to your home directory or Desktop. (Other destinations might work too).

As usual, comments and suggestions are welcome.
