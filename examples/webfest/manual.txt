Webfest Manual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Webfest has 20 levels which the player has to complete.
Each level is usually harder than the one before.

Each level consists of a web with a unique shape, and various enemies which you must destroy.


Controls:

D-PAD LEFT	Move left on the web
D-PAD RIGHT	Move right on the web
X		Fire
TRIANGLE	Smart bomb (when charge meter is full)
R-TRIGGER	Warp to next level (before level 10)


Extra Lives:

Your first extra life is at 20000 points.
Your 2nd extra life is at 50000 points.
You get an extra life every 50000 points thereafter.


Enemies:

Red Flipper	Flip occasionally and fire occasionally
Purple Tanker	Splits into 2 flippers when hit
Spiker		Leaves a lethal spike behind which must be avoided
UFO		Hangs around far end of the web, firing occasionally
Barrier		Block your shots and make life harder


Strategy:

Hitting enemies builds up your charge energy, while shooting a bullet uses up a unit of your charge energy. So accurate shooting is rewarded.

When the charge meter is full, it will flash, and the player will have rapid fire, and the ability to use the smart bomb (which destroys all enemies on the web). Choosing the right time to use the smart bomb is important. Also, the smart bomb uses all your charge energy, so you lose rapid fire.

Don't let the green spikers reach your end of the web - they will steal some of your charge if they do,

If you are on a level below level 10, then you can warp to the next level at any time by pressing R-trigger. However, you lose the opportunity to score points and build up your charge meter.


High Scores:

If your score is in the top ten scores, you will be asked to enter you initials, and your initials and score will appear in the high score table, along with the level that you reached.


Have fun!
