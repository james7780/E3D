This newer version of my 3D Model Editor was written because I was
having great difficulty finding a useable free 3D Model Editor on
the web. Because I needed a 3D model editor to create 3D objects
for a game I was writing, I decided I may as well just write one
quickly!

When I started hacking a little demo together for the PSX, I decided
that it would be nice to include support for .TMD files.

FEATURES:
~~~~~~~~
- Load/Save 3D Studio ASCII models (limited support!).
- Load/Save Truespace ASCII models (limited support!).
- Load/Save PSX .TMD models (~60% complete, including texture stuff).
- Load/Save cheap 'n easy .3DO format models (full support).
- Full vertex editing capabilities.
- Full polygon editing capabilities.
- Texture mapping functionality.
- Model transformations (can move/rotate/scale model).
- Easy to learn.
- Grid and snap-to-grid.
- Zoom/Pan in editing windows (Pan? I dunno...).
- Perspective display of model. (Full-screen preview coming soon!)
- Uses DJGPP compiler with Allegro.

GENERAL:
~~~~~~~
This program assumes some knowledge of how 3D models are put
together. The program was written specifically with 3D game
development in mind, as a way of creating 3D objects/models
that can easily be used by a 3D game engine. The .3DO file
format is used by my 3D game engine. (Details of this format
can be found in "3do.txt").

The two top windows in the editor are used to view different
projections of the model (top, front or side views) and to
select and move vertices. The current 3D cursor position is
shown in these windows as a diagonal crosshair (X). The 3D
cursor can be positioned anywhere in 3D space by clicking in
these windows, providing the windows are not showing the same view.

The perspective window shows an (almost) fully rendered view
of the model. The view of the model in the perspective window
can be changed using the buttons next to the window. Holding
the left mouse button down and dragging in the perpective
window will also rotate the model and move it up and down.
The "centroid" of every polygon in the object (even polygons
that are not visible) is displayed as a white dot. Right-clicking
the white dot will also select the polygon (and all the vertices
that comprise the polygon) for editing.
 

CREATING MODELS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 3 basic steps to create a 3D model with E3D:
1. Create Vertices (verts).
2. Create Polygons (polys) using these Vertices.
3. Mapping textures (optional).

To create a vertex:
1. Position the 3D cursor where you want your new vertex to
   appear in 3D space. (Switch on "SnapGrid" if you want to
   make the cursor stick to the grid points).
2. Select a colour using the RGB colour sliders.
3. Click on "Add Vert" to add this vertex to the vertex list.

The vertex will appear as a tiny coloured square in the 2 view
windows (Note: the vertex colour here is only used for editing
purposes, and is not used or saved in the model).

To create a polygon (or "face"):
1. Select the vertices that you want to use to define the
   "corners" of this polygon.
   Vertices must be selected in anticlockwise order (as is
   the usual fashion), when looking at the object from the
   outside.
   Vertices are selected by positioning the 3D cursor near
   a vertex, then pressing the SPACE bar.
   Up to 6 vertices can be selected.
   The last selected vertex can be unselected with the
   BACKSPACE key. Pressing the C key will unselect all.
2. Click the "Add Poly" button.

The polygon will appear in the perspective window (assuming  
that it is facing towards the perspective window "camera").
A wireframe outline of the polygon will also be shown in the
two edit windows.
NB: If you messed up and the polygon is facing the wrong way,
you can "reverse" the polygon by clicking the "Rev Poly"
button. Or you can click on "Del Poly" to delete it, then
create it again.

Other functions to create vertices:
The "Mirror" button will mirror all selected vertices
"along" one of the 3 axes.
The "Arc" button will create an arc of n vertices through m
degrees. These verts can then be rotated and xlated to
their final position. (not complete).


EDITING MODELS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Editing/Deleting Vertices:

To move a vertex: select it, then drag it with the right
mouse button.

Individual vertex  parameters can be modified by using the
"Edit Vert" dialog box. First select a vertex as explained
above, then click "Edit Vert". The dialog box that pops up
will allow you to edit the X, Y and Z co-ordinates of the
vertex, and the RGB components of the vertex's editing colour).

Vertices can be removed from the model by selecting and
clicking "Del Vert". Note that the program checks whether
the vertex "belongs" to any of the model's polygons, and
if so, will not allow you to delete it (otherwise the
model would be "broken"). To delete a vertex, you will
first have to delete all the polygons it belongs to.


2. Editing Polygons

Right-click in the middle of a polygon in the perspective
view. The polygomn will be selected, and the properties of the
polygon will be displayed in the poly properties area. Click
the cycle-buttons to change the poly light-shading (on/off)
[not implemented yet], gouraud-shading (on/off) [not implemented
yet], and filling type (flat, colour-interpolated, or textured).

The polygon's "flat-shaded" colour, and vertex colours (for
colour-interpolated rendering modes), are also displayed as
7 colour bars. Left-click a bar to copy the current RGB
slider colour to that bar. Right-click a bar to copy it's
colour top the RGB sliders.

All changes to a poly's properties take effect immediately.


3. Deleting Polygons:

Polygons can be deleted by clicking the "Del Poly" button.
First select a polygon by right-clicking in the middle of
the polygon in the perspective window (you might have to
rotate the perspective window view). The vertices of the
selected polygon will be highlighted in the two edit
windows. Then click "Del Poly" to remove the highlighted
polygon.
If you don't select a polygon before clicking "Del Poly",
the last polygon created will be removed. This is useful
for undoing a mistake when creating polygons, but is
probably not too wise to use on loaded models.


4. Model Transformations:

The "Rotate", "Scale" & "Xlate" buttons bring up dialogs
that allow you to transform the model in 3 dimensions.
They are pretty straightforward. Rotate works with
degrees. All transformations work on selected vertices
(you can select all vertices with SHIFT-SPACE).  Other
transformations (shear, noise, etc) will be included in
future versions on request. A user-definable "transformation
matrix" function might be a good idea too. Hmmm...


5. Texture-Mapping

To bring up the texture-mapping window, click the "Texture"
button in the right-hand view window. The current texture
is shown in the top-left corner of this window (max. size
of texture = 256x256). Below are shown the "thumbnail"
previews of the textures in the other 15 "texture pages".
Clicking on a thumbnail will make it the current texture.
Use the "Load TIM" button to load a .TIM image into the
current texture page.
Use the "Load TIM List" button to load a whole bank of
textures. TIM list file has the extension .LST, and just
contains a list of TIM file names (max. 16), each on a
seperate line.
To map a texture to a poly: Load a texture. Select a poly,
then cycle the filling-type to "texture". By default, the
texture coordinates will all be 0,0 (top-left corner of
the texture). Drag the texture co-ordinates to their
positions on the texture. The texture co-ordinates are
connected by lines of diminishing brightness (ie: tex
coord 0 and 1 are at either end of the brightest line).
It works, but you have to fiddle around a bit. I will
improve the interface in future releases.  


Notes on Loading/Saving and File Formats:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To save a file as a certain format, just make sure the
file has the right extension (.3DO, .COB, .ASC or .TMD) in
the Save Model dialog.
When loading model files, the format of the file is
assumed from it's extension.
There is limited support at the moment for .COB, .ASC,
and .TMD files. Total number of vertices and polygons is
presently limited to 512 each, since memory is pre-allocated
(number may change).

All the program bothers to read from the .COB files and
.ASC files is the vertex co-ordinates and the polygon
vertex indices. Materials are not supported yet.

When writing .COB or .ASC files, material info is
included, but is arbitrary. 3DS .ASC files are output
in "tri-mesh" format.

PSX .TMD file support is limited at present to single
colour, colour-gradated (???), and texmapped polys. Normals
are not supported (but will be soon). Texture-mapping support
is not complete (but will be soon).

Any suggestions regarding model file formats are
welcomed, specially as the current support is dismal.
(Bear in mind that this editor is designed purely with
3D games models in mind).

If you do use the progam, your comments and/or suggestions
are welcomed.
