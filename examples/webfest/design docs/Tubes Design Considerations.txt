1. Game focus
	- What is the game really about?
		eye-hand, reflex satisfaction 
	- What must the player do?
		*advance as far as possible by clearing webs
	- What is the fantasy?
		* defeat alien horde
	- What do I want the player to experience?
		* satisfaction at being dextrous enough to clear a web

2. Research, cogitate, meditate

3. Gfx and sound must *communicate* with player meaningfully.
	- barebones gfx
	- barebones sfx
	- sfx for each enemy "action" (eg: flip, split, etc)

4. Take special care with input
	- joystick/button "feel" must be right/natural
	- speed of movement on web needs to be tuned
	- fire rate and responsiveness needs to be tuned
	- option to use analog stick?

5. Learning curve
	- Should be linear
	- Allow player top start on a more difficult level (up to level 10?)
	- Analyse player failure (must not be too arbitrary)
		* failure through "overload" is OK
		* coll detect must be good
		* enemy visibility must be good
