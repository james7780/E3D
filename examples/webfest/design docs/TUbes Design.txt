1. Flat

4. Wide U


Possible story:
Evil Zarkons are speading thru the universe, creating death tubes which they will use to project dark matter beams to destroy planets.

Deenergise tube web by destroying web generators (requires special missiles that you collect by destroying enemies). Web then collapses.


Lessons learnt from Previous games:
1. Avoid slow gameplay
2. Collision detection must be good
3. Challenge must ramp up fairly quickly (new challenge every level)
4. No "sticky" / bastard webs

Engines:
1. 3D
2. Sequencing engine
3. Behaviour engine
4. 


Initial Implementation:

- 4 enemy types (flipper, pod, spiker, fuseball)
- 10 webs
- 4 powerups/bonuses (wingmen, 2x, 4x, shield)
- Wireframe gfx
- No sound
- Particle/frag effects (like asteroids)




Core Game Analysis:

Shooter/Dodger
3D Robotron (set number of enemies in "waves")
Strategy is in prioritising enemies
Challenge is in learning strategies to defeat webs
Challenge is in shooter skill to survive wave


Core Game Improvement:

Reduce "death randomness"
	- enemies more visible
	- good collision detection
Improve enemy AI (esp. how enemies work together)
	- enemies get smarter/faster at higher levels
	- enemies do unexpected things (suicide, get scared etc)
Improve weapons (grenades/bombs, lasers, etc)
Trap enemies (eg: time detonation of mines)
Add "collector" gameplay element (collect powerups, grenades)
Improve control
	- Jump (limited count, or must be enabled)
	- Dash (moves 4 "blocks" sideways)
Improve effects
	- Superzapper effect (web pulses?)
	- Enemy/player explosion effects
	- Bullet trail effects
	- More particles for bigger enemies
	- "web pulsing" effects (glowing/dimming, expanding contracting, etc)
	- bullet launch flash for enemies
Viewpoint
	- Option: Camera follows player round web
More recognisable "Areas":
	- Areas with recognisable themes:
		- blue zone
		- green zone
		- cyan zone
		- purple zone
		- etc
	- Each zone has a different mix of enemies
	- Each zone has slightly different strategies
	- Each zone has a different mix of powerups
	- Each zone has a different webs
	- Each zone has different background effects
	- 3 to 5 webs per zone
	- Zones give players more concept of progression
		"I got to green zone!"
	- Players can warp to a zone they've got to before.
	- Bonus rounds between zones/areas (every 4 levels)
		- Galaga/Gyruss-style shoot the alien formations (no grid)
		- Collect the cherries
	- Boss battles
		- Every 8 levels

Challenge
	- Using shooter skills, strategy and powerups to defeat webs
	- Hit percentage
